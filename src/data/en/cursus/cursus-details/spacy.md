# Spacy

Spacy is 2D mobile game in which the player pilot a spaceship and must destroy enemy bases while fighting with enemy spaceships.

I have started the development of this game at the end of 2017 and the foal was to create a classic space shooter with a multiplayer part.

I have dropped this project quickly because there were nothing inovative and the code was complex to maintain.

However, this project gave me a first insight of the multiplayer game development which helped me not to make the same mistakes during the development of Bulletfire.

Here are some screenshots of the project:
