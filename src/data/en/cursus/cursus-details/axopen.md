# Development internship at Axopen

I have done a development internship of two months (july and august 2020).

## Company description

Axopen is an IT company which mostly creates web and mobile applications for clients.

I arrived after the first Covid-19 wave in France so Axopen was forced to accept smaller projects than usual.
So I mostly work on those litle projects.

## Missions

### Showcase site

My main assignment was the creation of a web site for a client who wanted to modernize it's showcase site.

I have used Wordpress (PHP) with the Elementor plugin. This experience gave me more knowledge on the Wordpress ecosystem. I have created simple pages but also complex ones with the need of custom Elementor widgets
Les technologies utilisées étaient Wordpress (PHP) avec le plugin Elementor. J'ai donc eu l'occasion d'en apprendre plus sur l'écosystème Wordpress. J'ai également pu développer mes propres widgets avec Elementor.

I have executed this mission with another developer and with a manager who was handling the client relationship.

This project helped me understand the work with a demanding client.

Even though I would have preferred a mission with more exciting technologies, this project gave me the oportunity to acquire new skills and to discover Wordpress.

### Slide system

I have also worked for another client who waanted to update some slides for commercial purpose. This project has been realized with Html/Css with a custom JS framework already developped when I arrived.

### ERP

Finally, I worked on the company ERP to make a new general theme of the web application. I also added some graphs in a dashboard. The application is made with Java and JSF and I have done the theme with Sass.
