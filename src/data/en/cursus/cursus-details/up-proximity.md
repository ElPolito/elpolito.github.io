# Up Proximity

Up Proximity is a 2D mobile game in which the player pilot a spaceship which must catch an UFO while avoiding asteroids.

The development of the gamer began in 2016 and a first version was released, however, graphisms were not consistent (because gathered for various places in the internet). The project was therefore dropped for a while.

In 2019, I have decided to go back to work on the project by starting from scratch again. This time, I have created every designs by myself on Inkscape. The result is way more elegant thant the first time and the new version was released on the PlayStore few times after the beginning of the development.

Here are some screenshots of the game:
