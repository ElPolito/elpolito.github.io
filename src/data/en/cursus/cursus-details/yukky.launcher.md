# Yukky launcher

Yukky Launcher is a tool for indie or beginner game developers to provide them a simple way to handle the updates of their game(s).

This project is composed of a desktop application which will be distributed to the players and which will let them update the game. THis application has been developped with Electron and Typescript.
The project also contains a web application in which the developers can add new versions of their games and let them customize the launcher. This second application has been developped in React with Typescript.

The backend has been developped with NodeJS, Express and Socket.IO.

I had the idea of this project after the development of Bulletfire (the project realized during my two-year university degree). I realized that there were very few tools available and that they could be improved with more customization and some new functionalities.

I do not work on this project anymore for now but it is available [here](https://launcher.yukkyapp.com).
