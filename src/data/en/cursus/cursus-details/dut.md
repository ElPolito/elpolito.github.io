# Two-year university degree in Computer Science

After graduating high school, I went to IUT Lyon 1 to get a DUT (french two-year university degree) in computer science.

## Training content

The training content at the IUT was mostly technical, so I have acquired a lots of knowledge and skills like:

- Algorithm
- C
- System (concurrency, server)
- Java
- Python
- SGBD (Oracle, MySql)
- C#
- Html/Css
- Javascript

I have also realised a video game during this formation that I present in the section named "School project at IUT".
