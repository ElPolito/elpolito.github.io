# IT developer at Easylife

After my internship at Easylife I have been hired for a fixed-term contract of one month to work on another project.

## Company description

Easylife is not an IT company, it's main activity is the management of concierge service for big companies. The company creates specific places in their client's site where it's client's employees can access to various services.

## Mission

Even though Easylife is not an IT company, it has a IT service which manage the company ERP as well as new tools for the concierges.

My mission during this month was to continue the development of a cash management web application for the concierges. I have realized this project with another developer and a product owner who was the UX designer of the company.

At first, we used Scrum as our team management method but it was not adapted to the size of the team. Therefore, we switch to the Kanban method which worked well.

The cash management application has been developped with NodeJS, Express and Typescript for the backend and a MSSql database. The frontend part was developped with React and Redux.

This experience was very interesting because I was working in a team for a very concrete project for the first time. It was also the first I was using agile methods in a company.
