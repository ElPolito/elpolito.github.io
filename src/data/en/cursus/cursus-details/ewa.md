# Consultant at ETIC

Since October 2019, I am a consultant for ETIC Insa Technologies which is the junior enterprise of Insa Lyon.

I work, since April 2020, on a mission for EWA Solutions.

## EWA

EWa Solutions has contacted ETIC to create a payment mobile application for the countries in the north of Africa. The goal of this application is to give a simple solution to pay between individuals people and for little businesses.

I am developping this project with Flutter for the mobile application and Laravel (PHP) for the API and for the website.

The client asked in September 2020 to add a public API to allow the integration of EWA as a payment solution on an online shop.

The API and the website are currently hosted on Google Cloud.

This project gave me a first experience in the mobile development which I only knew from Unity before that. I have also discovered the Laravel framework and mostly the deployment on Google Cloud with the setup of a Continuous Deployment with Bitbucket and Google Cloud Build.

I also have been able to use Docker for the first time in a real project.

This experience is very interesting and I learned a lot on a technical level and on client relationship.
