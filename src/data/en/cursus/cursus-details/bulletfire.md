# Bulletfire

During my time at the DUT I did several projects including one which was very interesting because we where in a team of 6 and it lasted a year and a half. With my group, we decided to create a video game with Unity Engine.

In this game, two teams of four playres each fight in ten rounds. At the beginning of every round, players can buy weapons and equipments thanks to the money they received from the previous rounds. If you know the game CSGO, the principle is quite similar but to end a round, in Bulletfire, one team must eliminate every players threee times instead of one in CSGO.

We faced a lots of problems during the development of the game especially for the networking part or the communication with Socket.IO to handle the players' account, the chat and the matchmaking.

This project was very interesting and we learned a lot because for the first time I have managed to get a fine 3D multiplayer game.

The project is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/bulletfire-team)

Here are some screenshots of the game:
