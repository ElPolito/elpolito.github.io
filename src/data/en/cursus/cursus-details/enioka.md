# DevOps internship at enioka

I have done a three months and a half (may to august 2021) internship at enioka. My mission was to help in the setup of DevOps at a client.

## Company description

enioka is a company specialized in the IT production which works for various clients for consulting but also for support or development. The company is separated in three subsidiaries:

- Enioka Consulting for the consulting part
- Enioka ITTS for the suport
- Enioka Haute Couture for the development

During this internship I was working for Enioka ITTS

## Mission

After a gneral training on IT production during which I discovered ITIL, I have joined the integration team of a client in which I have setup various tools to help the DevOps in the company.

I have created some Ansible roles to configure Azure DevOps agents on Linux or on Windows. Next, I have integrated those roles on AWX to offer a simple user interface to reuse them.

Afterward, I worked on Azure DevOps pipelines to create reusable tools allowing project teams to easily integrate the best practices defined by the company for the build, the deployment or the release gates.
