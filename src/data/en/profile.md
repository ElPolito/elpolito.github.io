I am currently in formation in software enginnering at Insa Lyon University in France.

I discovered development in 2014 trying to create a video game with Unity Engine. After graduating high school, I have joined IUT Lyon 1 for a two-year university degree in Computer Science during which I acquired strong technical skills. At the end of this formation, I did an internship at Easylife where I developped a chatbot and a web application to configure it.

After that, I have joined Insa Lyon University in order to get a more global view of computer science but also to give me time to think about what domain in IT I was more interested into. During this formation, I have acquired advanced technical knowledge in a lots of IT domains (compilation, databases, processor, ...) and improved my ability to resolve complex problems.

I will join Ets University in august to get a master degree in software engineering.
